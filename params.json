Designed and constructed by [@jimiolaniyan](https://github.com/jimiolaniyan) and [@demukpere](https://github.com/demukpere), it is a modification of [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/PCB-Quadrotor-Brushless/?ALLSTEPS) by [Shane Colton](http://scolton.blogspot.com/).\r\n\r\nThis drone also has a voice-activation feature whereby the drone can be commanded through voice inputs to an android device that are sent over a wireless network using xbees.\r\n\r\n## Poster Presentation\r\nThe [abstract](https://github.com/jimiolaniyan/Awodi/blob/master/docs/abstract.pdf) for this work was accepted for the [2016 University of Lagos Research Conference and Fair](http://conference.unilag.edu.ng/) and we gave a poster presentation at the conference. See details [here](http://conference.unilag.edu.ng/)\r\n\r\n![Poster](http://res.cloudinary.com/siriusted/image/upload/v1481309752/IMG-20161109-WA0009_f4kpyf.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Extending Capabilities\r\nFuture modifications are targetted at modifying the platform to become autonomous by adding a camera for vision and navigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
