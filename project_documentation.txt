- Front/Back - CW
- Left/Right - CCW

- Right ESC - Yellow, Black Red,  from above view

- 3, 4, 5, 7 are working all on \portd3,4,5,7 

- ESC with highest starting PWM starts at 1219

- We can power the arduino VCC and 3.3V regulator from the ESC BEC

- There is a mysterious ground connection for the original RAW pin usage

- Non - intrusive soldering procedure:
      	- Left Xbee header
	- Arduino pins
	- IMU header
	- Right Xbee header 

>>>>	Wire to Soft I2C mapping
	- In setup Wire uses begin() for initialization of TWI and sets pins for SDA and SCL

Wire methods


- begin()
- available() - N/A
- requestFrom(address, count) - requestFrom()
- receive() - read()
- beginTransmission(address)
- send(byte) - write
- endTransmission()


Xbee shenanigans
- Xbee with SL 40BED067 appears not to receive 
- When programming arduino, do not have Xbee plugged in.
- Baud rate of 9600 is working right now, but try 57600 and document results. 

- GYR_ADDRESS for L3GD20H is (0xD6 >> 1) or 01101011b or 0x6B
- For setting the gyro, use 0x4F or 01001111b
- ACC_ADDRESS for LSM303D is (0x3A >> 1) or 00011101b or 0x1D 
- For setting the acc, use 0x57 or 01010111b

for SDA, SCL
- use pins 10 an A3, respectively??? Iono meihn.! It doesn't matter. Just choose in any order. Feel free to permutate.

When calling writeGyroReg and writeAccReg use the following to initialize the registers. 
- writeGyroReg(L3G4200D_CTRL_REG1, 0x4F); //Same as original code. 
  writeAccReg(LSM303_CTRL_REG1_A, 0b01010111);  //Was 0x27 in original. Now 0x57 or 0b01010111

- Check the datasheets to understand what the values used above are doing. Also check "IMU_SoftI2C_Test" for example usage

- I have included the two I2C libraries we checked in the I2C_Liraries Folder. 
- In "IMU_SoftI2C_Test" I am currently using "SoftI2CMaster-master - todbot" to test. 
- You may also try "SoftI2CMaster-master - Assembler" to ensure that the IMU readings are consistent

- I have written imu.h, our  own version of minimu9.h in the original code, which contains constants for the GRY and ACC

- As an aside, I think instead of creating new arduino files, when trying to make major changes(in order not to break things), I think 
  its better to take advantage of git and just commit changes so we can have a log of our progress.
